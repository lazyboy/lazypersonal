*Modified html5 app sample from Qt*

A qt project that renders a (local) webpage in qt app using webkit.
I've removed all magic (annoying) generated scripts that keeps mucking with the generated class (always modificiations are lost!).
Note that you need to open *.pro in QtCreator to compile and run.

Cheers.
