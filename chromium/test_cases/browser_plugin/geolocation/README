Browser plugin geolocation api test.
embedder.html is the embedder that embeds a guest which can location via html5 api (geolocation.html).
When requested (thru <input> button), the guest would eventually get location iff a. embedder allows (not yet implemented), b. embedder has access to geolocation.

One needs to replace FIX_ME in embedder.html with correct host name.
