This config files are almost completely copied from xmoand site's sample configs.
This uses two xmobar-s.
The configs for xmobar are also provided here.

FILES:
  xmonad.hs
  .xmobarrc
  .xmobarrc2

TODO: Clean it up and remove unwanted config in xmonad.hs

NOTE:
  The meta key has been changed to mod4 since I'm using a mac style keyboard and want mod to be the 'Command' key.

USAGE:
Copy xmonad.hs to ~/.xmonad/ {create directory if doesn't exist}
# xmonad --recompile
# nohup xmonad &
