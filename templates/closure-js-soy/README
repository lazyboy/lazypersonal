Minimal template for building and running closure javascript + soy.
A python wrapper script (compile.py) is added to show all the necessary bits, the script must be run from the directory of the file itself.
We use 'Closure Builder' (http://code.google.com/closure/library/docs/closurebuilder.html) to compile the javascript.

Todo:
1. You need to copy closure compiler jar under compile/ directory (compiler.jar, download from: http://closure-compiler.googlecode.com/files/compiler-latest.zip)
2. You need to copy soy to js compiler under soy/ directory (SoyToJsSrcCompiler.jar)
3. You need to download closure library source and fix the compile.py script's CLOSURE_BASE var to point to it.  

Note:
All js files need to be compiled would go under js/*.js or js/*[/*]....js
All soy files need to be compiled would go under soy/*.soy
The compiled output would be compiled.js on the top level.
