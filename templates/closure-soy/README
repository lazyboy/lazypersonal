Minimal template for compiling closure soy files to js files.
Run soy/compilesoy.py

Todo:
1. You need to copy soy to js compiler under soy/ directory (SoyToJsSrcCompiler.jar)

All soy files need to be compiled would go under soy/*.soy
The compiled js outputs for soy would be written under soy/gen/ directory.
